# Zelda Multiplayer RPG - Application Design Document

## Overview
Zelda Multiplayer RPG is a real-time multiplayer game inspired by the Legend of Zelda series. Players navigate a 2D grid-based world, avoiding enemies and competing for survival. The game features a client-server architecture, allowing multiple players to interact in the same game world simultaneously.

## Architecture
The application follows a client-server architecture:
- Frontend: Angular-based single-page application
- Backend: Node.js server with Express and Socket.IO for real-time communication
- The frontend communicates with the backend via WebSockets for real-time game state updates

## Technologies
- Frontend: Angular 17+
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Real-time Communication: Socket.IO
- Server-Side Rendering: Angular Universal
- Other: RxJS for reactive programming

## Key Components
1. AppComponent: The root component of the application.
2. ZeldaGameComponent: The main game component that renders the game board and handles user input.
3. GameService: Manages game state and communication with the server.
4. Server: Node.js server that manages the game state and broadcasts updates to connected clients.

## Data Model
- GameState: { players: Object, enemies: Object, gameOver: boolean, score: number }
- Player: { x: number, y: number, symbol: string }
- Enemy: { x: number, y: number, symbol: string }

## API Design
The application primarily uses WebSocket communication for real-time updates. Key socket events include:

| Event | Direction | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| joinGame | Client to Server | Player requests to join the game |
| movePlayer | Client to Server | Player sends movement command |
| gameState | Server to Client | Server broadcasts updated game state |
| restartGame | Client to Server | Player requests to restart the game |

## User Interface
Main screen:
1. Game Board: Displays a grid-based game world with players and enemies.
2. Game Over Overlay: Shows when a player collides with an enemy, displaying the score and a restart button.

The UI is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, with the game board centered in the viewport.

## Security Considerations
- Input validation: Ensure all player movements are validated on the server-side to prevent cheating.
- Rate limiting: Implement rate limiting on the server to prevent spam or DoS attacks.
- CORS: Configure proper CORS settings to restrict access to trusted origins.

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient rendering: The game uses a viewport system to render only the visible portion of the game world.
- Debouncing: Implement debouncing for player movement to reduce unnecessary network traffic.
- Server optimization: Use efficient data structures and algorithms for game state management and collision detection.

## Deployment
- Frontend Hosting: Can be deployed on any static file hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel)
- Backend Hosting: Node.js compatible platforms (e.g., Heroku, DigitalOcean)
- Containerization: Not currently implemented, but Docker could be used for easier deployment
- CI/CD: Not specified in the current setup, but could be implemented using GitHub Actions or similar services

## Future Enhancements
1. Player authentication: Implement user accounts and persistent player stats.
2. Multiple game rooms: Allow creation of separate game instances for different groups of players.
3. Power-ups and items: Add collectible items that provide temporary benefits to players.
4. Improved graphics: Enhance the visual appeal with sprite-based graphics instead of simple shapes.
5. Mobile support: Optimize the game for touch controls on mobile devices.

## Conclusion
The Zelda Multiplayer RPG demonstrates a basic implementation of a real-time multiplayer game using modern web technologies. The modular architecture allows for easy expansion and addition of new features. Future development should focus on enhancing gameplay elements, improving performance for larger numbers of concurrent players, and implementing user authentication for a more personalized experience.
